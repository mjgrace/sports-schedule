# Sports Schedule

This is a MERN app that uses docker compose.  It pulls API data from https:/api-football.com and stores it in a MongoDB database.  It then uses Express API's and displays the results using React.

It dynamically retrieves soccer/football schedules and retrieves scores and match status for all leagues.
