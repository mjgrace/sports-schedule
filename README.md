# Sports Schedule

This is a MERN app that uses docker compose.  It pulls API data from [https://api-football.com](https://api-football.com) and stores it in a MongoDB database.  It then uses Express API's and displays the results using React.

It dynamically retrieves soccer/football schedules and retrieves scores and match status for all leagues.

It currently pulls soccer/football schedules and results but the API allows for additional leagues to be retrieved and displayed.

To run the app, clone the repository, run `docker compose up` and then go to [http://localhost](http://localhost).
