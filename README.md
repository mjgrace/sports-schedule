# Sports Schedule

This is a MERN app that uses docker compose.  It pulls API data from https:/api-football.com and stores it in a MongoDB database.  It then uses Express API's and displays the results using React.

Currently league/season/team data is being retrieved.  The app is named "sports schedule" so I plan to add schedule data, depending on time available.
